            Full Stack Developer

          on a mission to craft impactful digital experiences. My journey began
          with curiosity and a laptop, but transformed into something bigger
          when I found my way to{" "}
          <span className="text-cyan-300 font-medium">Programming Hero</span>.
          Since then, I've been building full-stack applications that don't just
          work â€” they feel good to use.
          <br />
          <br />
          What drives me is more than just writing code. It's about creating
          solutions that solve real problems, building beautiful and intuitive
          interfaces, and making the web a better place one line at a time.
          <br />
          <br />
          I'm not just learning to get hired â€” I'm learning to make a
          difference. My dream is to grow into a developer who can lead teams,
          build products that matter, and never stop pushing the limits of
          what's possible on the web.
